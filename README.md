roadmap:

- technillogue.xyz (or register earnest.xyz?) http endpoints for registering a split and making an expense with a split
- mobile-friendly webpage form for the above

- script to push to technillogue.xyz and manage secrets

eventually, maybe:
- slack #receipts integration
- google sheets split calculation integration
- push income changes from slack
