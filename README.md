git submodule init/update, set up secrets, poetry init, poetry run python3.9 -i app.py, mkexpense()

roadmap:

- technillogue.xyz (or register earnest.xyz?) http endpoints for registering a split and making an expense with a split
- mobile-friendly webpage form for the above
- script to push to technillogue.xyz
- secrets managed as environment variables for easiest security

eventually, maybe:
- slack #receipts integration
- google sheets split calculation integration
- push income changes from slack
